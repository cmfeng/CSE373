## Homework 4 - Graphs and Shortest Paths

For this assignment, you will develop a graph representation and use it to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths. Unlike previous assignments, you will use some classes in the Java standard libraries, gaining valuable experience reading documentation and understanding provided APIs. Also, part of the grade for your code will depend on you "protecting the graph abstraction" leveraging copy-in-copy-out and immutability as we discussed (or will discuss) in class.
